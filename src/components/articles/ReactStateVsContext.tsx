        When working with React, effectively handling state is vital for
        creating solid applications. React offers two main methods for managing
        state: using the built-in state and the Context API. Understanding when
        to use each method can make your development process smoother.

        <span className="text-lg font-bold">* React State</span>
        <br />
        React's state is great for handling data that's specific to a single
        component. It's simple and lightweight, making it suitable for
        components that don't need to share data widely. You can modify state
        using the setState function. However, if you have deeply nested
        components or if multiple components require the same data, managing
        state this way can become a bit unwieldy.

      <p className="mt-2 text-base text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400">
        <span className="text-lg font-bold">* React Context</span>
        <br />
        The Context API is designed to tackle the issue of passing data between
        components, bypassing the need for middlemen. It's useful when you want
        to share data globally, like user authentication states or themes.
        Context lets you provide data to components without manually passing
        props through every intermediary component. However, it might be overly
        complex for smaller projects.

        üèÅ Conclusion
      </h1>
      <p className="mt-2 text-base text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400">
        To decide between React state and React Context, consider the scale of
        your project and how components need to share data. Use React state for
        local, component-specific data, and turn to React Context for larger
        projects with data that needs to be accessible across various
        components. Making the right choice will lead to a more organized and
        efficient React application.
